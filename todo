- it seems like we need 2 internal variables for each account. a nonce for how many notifications you have received in total, and another number, for how far behind you are from having seen all of the notifications. # unseen notifications.
The nonce is needed for the delayed response api.
the unseen notifications is needed so that even if you load the website from a different computer, it still says the correct number of unseen notifications.

* delegating coins or coin hours, especially with cold storage.

* most popular posts according to who you follow.


* this account is followed by these users who you are following.

* timestamps on posts.

* send a dm

* browse dms

* memoize posts and accounts, so we don't have to re-download them so frequently.
